# todo-app

this is my one month web development project. This project won't be me just coding along a yotube tutorial - everything done here will be me writing my own lines of code(even though the idea of the app and MVP was given by theodinproject.com)


MVP(minimum viable product):
1) The app has an interface, where you can create projects.
2) Inside those projects you can add todos - you should be able to update its date, set an end date, delete it.

Nice to have:
1) CSS visuals.
2) Additional functionality(will probably think of some while doing the project).

Steps(documentation on what i am doing, how long it took and what my next steps are):
~1hour 1) environment setup(webpack and all of the magic of it). Took some time - had to read some of the documentation again.
2) Figuring out the js file imports and exports, creating multiple js files and thinking of the funcionality that they will have(try to follow SOLID principles).
